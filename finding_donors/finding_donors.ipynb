    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Based on the evaluation of the three models above, the one performing best in terms of the F-score on the whole testing set (if, even only by a small margin) is the Bagging Classifier (a Random Forest Classifier was also included for comparison against the Bagging Model, but here, the Bagging Classifier performed slightly better). The Stochastic Gradient Descent Model and the Support Vector Model performed similarlyn in terms of their F-score. However, the biggest disadvantage of the Support Vectoe Machine is it's slow runtime with a prediction and training time coming close to 2.5 minutes. Depending on the size of the dataset, this can become a bigger problem, as we'd expect both the training data and the data used for prediction to grow in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the fact that we're more interested in predicting whether an individual is likely to earn more than 50K$, the disadvantage that SDG doesn't provide probability scores and the Bagging model makes the predictions less interpretable are trade-offs that should not become too big of a problem. Still, due to its great flexibility, I would recommend using the Bagging Model rather than the others, as they yield similar results before optimization."

    "For the Bagging Model, we combine the predictions of several 'weak learners', i.e. models that are not particularly good at classifying the data. If we think of the data in terms of points on a plane, then the weak learners just draw a line, classsifying points on one side into one class and points on the other side into another class. We train these weak learners on random subsets of our sample, so that we don't have to train different models on the same data, which would be rather expensive. With enough data, taking random subsets will allow us to get a good idea of the data.\n",
    "We then impose them over the data, and let each weak learner vote how they would classify a case to arrive at a prediction.\n",

How this translates depends on how flxible an individual is in increasing or decreasing those numbers and whether they are paid more for overtime. For married people, this might be due to the cross-relationship between age and the marital status of a person. Furthermore, it might be that married couples can get a benefit from organizing an household together, being more efficient with investments, saving and advancing their (or one spouse's) careers."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
